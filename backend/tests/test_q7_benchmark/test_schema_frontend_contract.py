"""Backend↔frontend B4-lite schema contract (the #1 architectural risk).

The `.dna` / `.entropic` portability thesis (Vision §2, strict no-regression)
requires the backend `modulation/schema.py` enums and the frontend
`shared/axis-binding.ts` canonical union to serialize IDENTICAL strings. If they
diverge, a frontend-saved patch fails to load on the backend (and vice versa),
silently corrupting cross-version portability.

DISCOVERED 2026-06-04 (master-sequence P2): they DO diverge today —
  - BindingRule values: backend snake_case ("sample_at"/"scan_over") vs
    frontend camelCase ("sampleAt"/"scanOver").
  - Member count: backend 5 vs frontend 8 (frontend adds hilbert/polar/learned).

This test encodes the REQUIRED agreement and is xfail(strict=True) until PR-B
reconciles. When PR-B fixes the schema, this test "unexpectedly passes" → strict
xfail turns that into a failure prompting removal of the marker (self-clearing
guard). Reconciliation guidance: `~/.claude/plans/entropic-P2-schema-fork-finding.md`.
